# About Michael Rangel

Welcome to my page, my name is Michael Rangel! I'm a freshman at Boise State University studying Computer Science! I've always loved computer science ever since I was a little kid. My love for the subject stems from playing video games, specifically Super Mario Galaxy on the wii. As time went on, I would watch youtube videos explaining different CS topics and I just continued to fall in love with the subject. Eventually, I started teaching myself C# and trying to make simple projects. I have used a modding api called tmodLoader to mod a game called Terraria, I created a simple windows application using C# and Xaml, and I've made a simple game using javascript.

## Interests
* I like video games
* I like anime and manga
* I like jpop
  * My favorite artist is Ado
* I love computer science a lot :3
  
## What are my goals?
I hope to one day either collaborate with a team or work by myself to bring a game to life. I've always been interested in game development and making the systems that games run off of sounds really fun! I'm also interested in graphics programming and I intend to teach myself OpenGL and try to make a simple 3D renderer. It's not going to be easy, but I think I can pull it off!
